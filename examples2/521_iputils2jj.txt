You may know this:
Lotto combination 1-2-3-4-5-6 has the same chance of being drawn as any other
lottery combination. But the combination 1,2,3,4,5,6 should not be played. It
represents a weird arrangement of lottery numbers. Why?
If one hits the jackpot, you should be advised to never play the statistically
dreadful 1,2,3,4,5,6!

1. If the lotto 6/45 has a total of 8,145,060 comb., and only one is drawn as 
the winner, the probability is undeniably 1 / 8,145,060.

All shapes have, however, the same probability of appearance. Reality only has
a different idea! There been thousands of lotto drawings conducted worldwide.
We should have seen by now a lottery combination of the type 1,2,3,4,5,6. There
has been none so far or you know anyone?.

2. Furthermore, you can use the code to generate all lotto combinations in
lexicographic order for any experiment or game. Beware! The output files can be
extremely large, for 6/45 is about 240 MB!

One interesting point at all is the binominal coefficient. It means that you get
the same amount of combinations with 6 or 39 tips (crosses) of 45!

Cause the mathematics shows
3. Combination (binominal coefficient)= nCr = n!/(k! * (n-k)!)
                                             45! /6! * 39!
so you can see 6 or 39 are interchangeable...

The probabilities are equal, but the combinations are not equal.

Maybe due to increased popularity of maXbox the total number of open bug reports has grown, now 30+ and counting. New reports are opened faster than developers can solve them. Most of them are minor, none of them are critical.


 Net Applications: Windows 8 verliert Marktanteile
Meldung vorlesen und MP3-Download

Whrend Windows 8 Marktanteile verliert, verbucht Windows 7 leichte Zuwchse. XP ist weiterhin beliebt und belegt in der Statistik von Net Applications den zweiten Platz. Der Anteil von OS X und Linux verndert sich kaum.

Laut Untersuchungen der Marktforscher von Net Applications zur Verbreitung von PC- Betriebssystemen hat Windows 8.x zuletzt Marktanteile verloren  und das ausgerechnet an den Vorgnger Windows 7. Auf lediglich 12,3 Prozent der beobachteten Rechner sollen die aktuellen Windows-Versionen laufen, was einem Rckgang von 1,1 Prozent im Vergleich zu August entspricht. Windows 7 hingegen konnte sich im letzten Monat um 1,5 Punkte verbessern und erreicht somit eine neue Bestmarke von 52,7 Prozent. Trotz eingestelltem Support ging die Nutzung von Windows XP nur leicht zurck (minus 2,5 Prozent). Das ber zehn Jahre alte Betriebssystem findet sich mit 23,9 Prozent auf dem zweiten Platz in der Statistik wieder.
